                With the Green Roll we contribute mainly to the UN Sustainable
                Development Goal number 6, clean water and sanitation for
                everyone by 2030. We believe clean drinking water and clean
                sanitation have a positive impact on other Sustainable
                Development Goals, such as food safety, education and health.
                Clean toilets in schools ensure that more girls continue going
                to school, even when they have their period. Besides, children
                become less susceptible to diseases, both of which result in a
                more educated youth which will be better equipped to contribute
                to the economy.

                Millions of people still die every year from diseases caused by
                poor sanitation and this has a direct impact on the local
                economy. Currently, 1.8 billion people still get their drinking
                water from polluted sources and an additional 2.4 billion people
                still have no access to clean toilets and other sanitary
                facilities.

                A lot of waste products are still thrown away in bodies of
                water. To improve the quality of water across the globe, this
                form of pollution must stop and waste water must be purified.
                All countries should have a properly functioning water
                management system, if feasible, by 2030. Check out the figure
                below to see what SDG's The Green Roll contributes to:

                  Every financial year, we publish our annual financial
                  statements. The donation goes to our Foundation, which
                  distributes it over our own projects and for example
                  collaborations with SIMAVI. Our impact meter shows how many
                  toilets we have built and will build. This impact meter is
                  therefore partly fictitious. It does, however, give a good
                  picture of our mission, the current projects and what the
                  counter will look like when we draw up our annual figures.

                  The Green Roll Foundation, the corporate social responsibility
                  arm of The Green Roll, was established in 2018. Each year, The
                  Green Roll donates 50% of its net profit to the construction
                  of safe and clean toilets in developing countries. The
                  projects we engage in, besides building the sanitary
                  facilities, are related to education on sanitary products,
                  such as toilet rolls, menstruation pads, and soap.

                  The Green Roll Foundation has one goal: to make sustainable
                  sanitation available. Our Foundation was established to spend
                  the money we raise through the sale of our rolls on the
                  construction of sanitation, without making a profit in the
                  process. We believe in our entrepreneurship. We reserve a
                  maximum amount for the donation to our foundation and for our
                  cooperation with SIMAVI. All for the construction of toilets.
                  Therefore we have fixed our "overhead costs" to a maximum of
                  30%. If the costs exceed 20%, the extra costs will be deducted
                  from our profit share and will not be charged to our
                  Foundation.

                  Our main priority is to improve children’s lives and therefore
                  we mainly focus on schools and their communities within Ghana.
                  The foundation contributes mainly to the United Nations
                  Sustainable Development Goal number six: “Clean water and
                  Sanitation for all by 2030”. In this way we remain fully
                  focused on our mission: building toilets and improving
                  people's lives in countries where they lack these basic
                  facilities.
